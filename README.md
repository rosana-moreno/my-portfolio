# PORTFOLIO
Hey I'm Rosana, I built this site as a practice project from Codecademy's Front-End Engineer course.
The requirements were to:

- Build a website using HTML, CSS
- Add at least one interactive feature using JavaScript
  (I chose the hamburger-menu)
- Use Git version control
- Use the command line and file navigation
- Develop locally on your computer
- Deploy your site to the web using GitHub Pages
